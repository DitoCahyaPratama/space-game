Demo game for teaching purposes.

## Teaching steps

* Create a player character using JavaScript
* Use keyPress events first. Show that they are quite "choppy". Switch to keyUp / keyDown and update loop.
* Create entities using createElement
* Find elements using querySelectorAll / querySelector
* Change size of elements through JS or CSS.
* Set position but it doesn't work! Don't forget to set position absolute in CSS.
* Position:absolute against what? Make sure you set position: relative on game container.
* Overflow: hidden on game container
* Figure out the key codes
* Winning / losing condition
* Ship can go offscreen: clamping
* Use transform instead of left/top
* When using transform, center using margin-left: negative value;
